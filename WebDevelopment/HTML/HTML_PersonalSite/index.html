		<p>Hey everyone! My name is Sterling Green. I am an AWS Certified Developer with a strong background in Full Stack development. I have experience using a variety of coding languages, including Python, CSS, Java Script and HTML, and am skilled in using tools such as Ubuntu, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Grafana, Node Red, InfluxDB, Selenium, and Plotly. I have a passion for creating dynamic, user-friendly applications and am constantly learning and staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and best practices in the field. Whether working on a small project or a large-scale enterprise application, I bring a highly collaborative and solution-oriented approach to every project.</p>
